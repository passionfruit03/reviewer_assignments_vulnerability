# Vulnerability of Text-Matching in ML/AI Conference Reviewer Assignments to Collusion Rings
### Datasets
The NeurIPS 2023 dataset can be found under the `conference_data/NeurIPS_2023/` folder, and the NeurIPS 2022 dataset can be found under `conference_data/NeurIPS_2022/`. For each dataset, we provide the OpenReview links of public paper submissions to the conference in `paper_links.txt`. In the `reviewer_profiles.jsonl` file, we provide each reviewer's OpenReview ID and the list of papers (links) in their archive. To access a reviewer's profile online, you can use the link https://openreview.net/profile?id=OpenReviewID. 

### Adversarial Abstracts
We make public the adversarial abstracts that we have generated for this paper. Under the `abtract_examples/` folder, there are subfolders named by the respective sections in the paper. We provide examples of adversarially modified abstracts that are generated and evaluated in that section of the paper.

### Prompts
We provide the prompts used for our experiments under the `prompts/` folder. In addition, we provide the few-shot examples used to guide LLM-based abstract generation for all our experiments in the `prompts/operation_name/few_shot_examples/` folder.
