# Vulnerability of Text-Matching in ML/AI Conference Reviewer Assignments to Collusion Rings
## Datasets
Compressed files of conference data can be downloaded from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ua9ljIW2JgUtA0_iCVC6lDDLI65x0gVW?usp=sharing).
### NeurIPS 2022
- `reviewer_ids.txt`: A file containing the OpenReview IDs of the curated list of reviewers at the conference. Each reviewer's OpenReview profile can be accessed at https://openreview.net/profile?id=OpenReviewID.
- `archives/`: A directory containing `{reviewer_id}.jsonl` files, where each file contains the default archive consists of up to 10 papers written by the reviewer.
- `publication_embeddings_v1/`: A directoy containing `{reviewer_id}.npy` files, where each file contains the SPECTER embeddings of each paper in the reviewer's archive. Please see `scripts/reviewer_embeddings.py` for the code that generated the publications embeddings.
- `archives_embeddings_v1/`: A directory containing `{reviewer_id}.npy` files, where each file is a vector that is the mean of the normalized SPECTER embeddings of that reviewer. Please see `scripts/reviewer_embeddings.py` for the code that generated the archive embeddings.
- `submission_ids.txt`: A file containing the OpenReview paper IDs of the curated list of paper submissions to the conference. The openreview paper links can be found at https://openreview.net/forum?id=PaperID.
- `submission_metadata.json`: A file containing the title, abstract, and list of authors metadata for each submission to the conference.

### NeurIPS 2023
This dataset has the same files as described above, but the contents of the files are for the NeurIPS 2023 conference. In addition, this dataset have the following extra data:
- `arxiv_ids.txt`: A file containing the 914 arXiv ids (links) of the curated list of papers for the human study experiment.
- `arxiv_metadata.json`: A file containing the title, abstract, and list of authors metadata for each arxiv paper in the `arxiv_ids.txt` file.
- `evaluation_samples/` A directory of files containing colluding (paper, reviewer) pairs for our experiments in the results section.

<!-- The NeurIPS 2023 dataset can be found under the `conference_data/NeurIPS_2023/` folder, and the NeurIPS 2022 dataset can be found under `conference_data/NeurIPS_2022/`. For each dataset, we provide the OpenReview links of public paper submissions to the conference in `paper_links.txt`. In the `reviewer_profiles.jsonl` file, we provide each reviewer's OpenReview ID and the list of papers (links) in their archive. To access a reviewer's profile online, you can use the link https://openreview.net/profile?id=OpenReviewID.  -->

### Adversarial Abstract Examples
We make public the adversarial abstracts that we have generated for this paper. Under the `abtract_examples/` folder, there are subfolders named by the respective sections in the paper. We provide examples of adversarially modified abstracts that are generated and evaluated in that section of the paper.

### Prompts
We provide the prompts used for our experiments under the `prompts/` folder. In addition, we provide the few-shot examples used to guide LLM-based abstract generation for all our experiments in the `prompts/operation_name/few_shot_examples/` folder.

### Run Code
Download and unzip the datasets. Change the dataset path in `attack/main.py` and run `python attack/main.py`.
