    "title": "On Trade-Offs Between Fairness, Robustness, and Privacy Through Tilted Losses",
    "abstract": "Drawing upon transformative advancements in machine learning (ML) across natural language processing, sustainable agriculture, and predictive healthcare, our research delves into the nuanced interplay of fairness, robustness, and privacy. These foundational studies underscore ML's pivotal role in tackling complex challengesâ€”from enhancing language understanding to optimizing agricultural practices and improving patient outcomes. Against this backdrop, our work seeks to bridge a critical gap in the literature by exploring the trade-offs among fairness (in terms of representation disparity), robustness (against malicious training samples), and privacy (through differential privacy), within a unified framework of exponential tilting. This approach not only acknowledges the multifaceted considerations necessitated by algorithm design and application across various domains but also advances our understanding and methodologies in ensuring that ML applications are fair, robust, and privacy-preserving."
