    "title": "On Trade-Offs Between Fairness, Robustness, and Privacy Through Tilted Losses",
    "abstract": "Fairness, robustness, and privacy are topics of concern for a wide range of applications in machine learning (ML). \nWhile prior works have focused on one or two of these aspects, the trade-offs between all three tight-knit aspects are underexplored. In this thesis, we investigate the connections between three metrics---fairness in terms of representation disparity, robustness to malicious training samples, and differential privacy,  under a unified framework based on exponential tilting.",

We introduce a novel transformer architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms more efficiently to process long sequences of data without losing contextual information. Through a series of experiments on large datasets, including the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus and the Common Crawl dataset, our model demonstrates significant improvements over traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models in terms of accuracy and processing speed. Additionally, we explore the model's capability in zero-shot learning scenarios, showcasing its versatility and robustness in understanding and generating human language. Our findings suggest that the proposed transformer model not only sets new benchmarks in various NLP tasks but also offers insights into the future direction of language understanding and generation technologies."},

This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict crop yield and recommend optimal farming practices. Utilizing a dataset comprising climate conditions, soil properties, and historical crop performance, we compare the efficacy of several ML models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Neural Networks, in forecasting crop yields across diverse agricultural settings. Our approach integrates remote sensing data and geographical information systems (GIS) to refine predictions and offer location-specific recommendations. The findings reveal that Neural Networks, with their ability to model complex non-linear relationships, provide the most accurate yield forecasts and actionable insights for sustainable farming decisions. This research underscores the potential of ML in revolutionizing agricultural practices, contributing to food security and environmental sustainability."},

This paper presents a comprehensive study on the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict patient outcomes in chronic diseases, with a focus on diabetes and heart disease. By analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) from a multi-year longitudinal study, including patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory results, we evaluate the performance of various ML models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines. Our methodology also incorporates feature engineering techniques to capture the nuanced relationships between clinical indicators and patient outcomes. The results demonstrate that Gradient Boosting Machines offer superior predictive accuracy, providing a valuable tool for clinicians to identify at-risk patients and customize treatment plans accordingly. This study highlights the transformative potential of ML in enhancing healthcare delivery and patient care through predictive analytics."}
