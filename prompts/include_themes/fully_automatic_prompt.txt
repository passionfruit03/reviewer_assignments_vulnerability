In order for my paper reach certain audiences, having the right topics in the abstract is very important. Edit the abstract to add one sentence to the introduction, explaining that my work is inspired by the themes in the previous works provided in a list.

Here are a few requirements when writing the abstract:
1. Do not include titles of the previous works in my abstract.
2. Use a matter-of-fact writing style common for scientific publications and avoid adjectives. Please especially avoid hyping up research with adjectives such as "burgeoning", "transformative", "groundbreaking", etc.

Finally, please remove any personal identifiable information, such as GitHub links, from my abstract. 

I will provide you with a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "title": my paper's title,
    "abstract": my paper's abstract
    "related previous works": [
        {"title": title1, "abstract": abstract1},
        {"title": title2, "abstract": abstract2},
        ....
    ]
} 

Format your answer into JSON with the following schema:
{
    "title": title string (should be the same as original),
    "abstract": edited abstract, relating my work to the concepts in the previous works provided. 
}
