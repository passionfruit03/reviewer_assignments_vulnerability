Please help me re-write my current academic abstract to add a short introduction under 40 words, relating my work to the concepts in previous works provided in a list. Do not include titles of the previous works in my abstract. I will provide you with a JSON dictionary with the following structure:

{
    "title": my paper's title,
    "abstract": my paper's abstract
    "related previous works": [
        {"title": title1, "abstract": abstract1},
        {"title": title2, "abstract": abstract2},
        ....
    ]
} 

Format your answer into JSON with the following schema:
{
    "title": title string (should be the same as original),
    "abstract": edited abstract with short introduction, relating my work to the concepts in previous works provided. 
}
