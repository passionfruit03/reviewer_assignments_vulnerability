Please help me edit my abstract's introduction to explain in one sentence that my work is inspired by the list of previous works in the provided JSON dictionary under the key "related previous works". Do not include the titles of previous works.

Use the usual writing style of technical academic abstracts, avoid exaggerations and figurative language. Do not use flowery words or phrases such as "prowess". In addition, please remove any identifiable information (e.g. GitHub URLs) in my abstract by simply replacing them with [omitted for de-identification].

I will provide you with a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "title": my paper's title,
    "abstract": my paper's abstract,
    "related previous works": [
        {"title": title1, "abstract": abstract1},
        ....
    ]
} 

Format your answer into JSON with the following schema:
{
    "title": title string (should be the same as original),
    "abstract": edited abstract with short introduction, explaining my work is inspired by the previous works provided
}
