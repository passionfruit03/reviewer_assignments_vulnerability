  "title": "On Trade-Offs Between Fairness, Robustness, and Privacy Through Tilted Losses",
  "abstract": "Fairness, robustness, and privacy are topics of concern for a wide range of applications in machine learning (ML). \nWhile prior works have focused on one or two of these aspects, the trade-offs between all three tight-knit aspects are underexplored. In this thesis, we investigate the connections between three metrics---fairness in terms of representation disparity, robustness to malicious training samples, and differential privacy,  under a unified framework based on exponential tilting.",
