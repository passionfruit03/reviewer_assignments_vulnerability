In order for my paper to reach certain audiences, having the right keywords in the abstract is very important. I will provide you with a JSON dictionary with three keys: "title", "abstract" and "keywords". I want you to insert each keyword to the abstract based on its meanings commonly used in general English or meanings related to the technical details in the abstract. 

Here are a few requirements when writing the abstract:
1. You must write a professional and scientifically rigorous abstract. Use a matter-of-fact tone.
2. Use well-known facts in the scientific community when inserting keywords. Do not make changes to the parts related to this specific paper. 
3. Some keywords may already exist in the abstract, but you must repeat the keyword somewhere else in the abstract. 

Finally, some keywords are out of the scope of the abstract. You may reject them and provide a short 20-word explanation of why.

Format your answer into JSON with the following schema:
{
    "title": title string (should be the same as original),
    "abstract": edited abstract string,
    "left out keywords": {
        first rejected keyword: 20-word explanation of why the keyword is rejected.
        ...
    }
}
