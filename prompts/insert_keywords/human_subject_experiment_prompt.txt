Please help me edit my academic paper abstract to include a few provided keywords. Use the usual writing style of technical academic abstracts, avoid exaggerations and figurative language. Do not use flowery words or phrases such as "prowess". I will provide you with a JSON dictionary with three keys: "title", "abstract" and "keywords". 

I want you to insert each keyword provided in the JSON to the abstract based on its meanings commonly used in general English or meanings related to the technical details in the abstract. Avoid inserting the words to the first or the last sentences of the abstract. In addition, please do not make changes to the title. 

Some keywords are not commonly used in English and are not technically related to the main topics of the paper; please exclude them and provide a short 20-word explanation of why the keyword is unrelated to my abstract. However, you must insert a keyword that carries broad and general meanings; you cannot exclude it.

Format your answer into JSON with the following schema:
{
    "title": title string (should be the same as original),
    "abstract": edited abstract string,
    "left out keywords": {
        first excluded keyword: 20-word explanation of why the keyword is excluded.
        ...
    }
}

If a keyword is not excluded as "left out keywords", you must add it to the edited abstract. When inserting each keyword, you should use either technical or commonly used English meanings. Please add more instances of the keywords that are already present in the submission's abstract.
